I had a pet lizard, he never got an obit
Fed him crickets, it was dead a fucking month before I noticed
An older me would note that whether disposable goldfish
Or theist, we certainly become the earth as equals, in a circle
Unique until the spirit isn't willing
While the flesh is still a staple of the labor force and whistling
It's roadkill evoking emotion his own totem don't
That's a reality you evade or grow to own
Social code broke and a hierarchy to gasp at
Black labs over wack dads on the admat
Tabby over parasite, bats at the parish
A civil war becoming of ungovernable atoms
I'm born from the guts of stars and black tar pits
Iron Maiden denim paint the devil under grawlix
Crawls out a clawed coffin to huff and puff
Somewhere in between the dust and dust
Ripped the phone up out the wall
I pay a guy to lean over steepled fingers
And convince me to pay him for his teas and tinctures
The string cheese dinner kid speak Cheech wizard
Life into vitamins, invited up to cypresses
A testament to moxie and the miracle of lifelessness
It's tricky when you'd rather rot into the soil as a nutrient
Than navigate this mortal coil in human skin, dig?
The nuances of putrefying jelly hit the levee
When those feathers are a cancer in your bestie
And I pick a ginger gold as fed by a drunken uncle
One from a customer pumping that Sumner blood work
Memitim ascending, settling any high scores
40 meters up with the heart of a high dive horse
Free, forged in various pulp channels
Even his prize horse rides a wolf into battle
He spends his hours pacing around with a bag of bones
Poison works in city camps, in parasite mode
Don't wanna get his goddamned combo together
And he did it without interference from city dweller
Ripped the phone up out the wall
I pay a guy to lean over steepled fingers
And convince me to pay him for his teas and tinctures
The string cheese dinner kid speak Cheech wizard
I told my ex in '97 I was falling on my weapon
The po' would drag me from my bedroom
An embarrassing ordeal involving hospitals and questions
And the kind of doctors who use words like "cognitive" and "spectrum"
While explaining why you're selfish to romanticize a ruse
In which unruly roots pull you to Lucifer by your shoes
I mean, it isn't perfect but don't misconstrue the purpose
Any urge is indiscernible from community service to the kiddo
Plus she'd make a beautiful widow
But that's an altruistic ticket to a room with no windows
Hmm you'd think he would've learned back in the 80s
When they pulled him out of class over concerns about his safety
But he didn't, it wasn't cause he doesn't get the message
More he doesn't judge a man by how honorable his death is
Half past out to pasture
Whether clapped or batteries in backwards
